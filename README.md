# The famous "99 problems" (originally written for Prolog)
inspired by http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

My solutions to the 99 problems in mostly Scala, with errata of Python/Ruby (and maybe Haskell).

The goal is to do all the two-star or three-star difficulty problems, marked by 2 or 3 asterisks, as decided by Phil Gold at aperiodic.net.
