# The famous "99 problems" (originally written for Prolog)
inspired by http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

My solutions to the 99 problems in Scala (with adequate testing).

The goal is to do all the two-star or three-star difficulty problems, marked by 2 or 3 asterisks, as decided by Phil Gold at aperiodic.net.

Scala will take first priority. If that goes well, I'll try to do **Python** -- if I get really enthusiastic, **Haskell**.
