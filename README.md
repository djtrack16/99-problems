# The famous "99 problems" (originally written for Prolog)
inspired by http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

My solutions to the 99 problems in Scala, Typescript, Haskell, and Ruby.

The goal is to do all the two-star or three-star difficulty problems, marked by 2 or 3 asterisks, as decided by Phil Gold at aperiodic.net.

It's a really convenient way for me to learn the basic gymnastics of a new language before I go on to more complex projects.
